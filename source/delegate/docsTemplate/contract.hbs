## Price Calculations

All amounts are in the smallest unit (e.g. wei), so all calculations based on price result in a whole number. For calculations that would result in a decimal, the amount is rounded in the delegate's favor. For example, a price of 5.25 and senderParam of 2 results in signerParam of 11 rather than 10.5. Tokens have many decimal places so these differences are very small.

### Examples

### Examples using DAI and WETH tokens

Set a rule to send up to 100,000 DAI for WETH at 0.0032 WETH/DAI. Note that DAI has a decimal representation of 18 and WETH has a decimal representation of 18 as well. Another way to think about this is that this rule is putting 100,000 DAI up for trade in return for WETH.

Set a rule to send up to 100,000 DAI for WETH at 0.0032 WETH/DAI

setRule(DAIAddress, WETHAddress, 100000000000000000000000, 32, 4)

Set a rule to send up to 320 WETH for DAI at 0.0032 WETH/DAI.

setRule(WETHAddress, DAIAddress, 320000000000000000000, 3125, 1)

### Example using AST and WETH tokens

setRule(ASTAddress, WETHAddress, 50000000, 40000000000, 0)

Set a rule to send up to 2 WETH for AST at 0.0004 AST/WETH. Note that AST has a decimal representation of 4 and WETH has a decimal representation of 18.

setRule(WETHAddress, ASTAddress, 2000000000000000000, 25, 12)
