# Delegate

**:warning: This package is under active development. Do not use in production.**

[AirSwap](https://www.airswap.io/) is a peer-to-peer trading network for Ethereum tokens. This package contains source code and tests for a basic `Delegate` contract that can be deployed with trading rules.

:bulb: **Note**: `solidity-coverage` does not cooperate with `view` functions. To run test coverage, remove the `view` keywords from functions in `Delegate.sol` and `IDelegate.sol`.
