1. Start the graph node from `graph-node/docker` by running `docker-compose up` 
1. From `airswap-protocols/tools/subgraph` run `yarn prepare:development && yarn codegen && yarn remove-local; yarn create-local; yarn deploy-local`
1. Run queries against the endpoint at the end of the previous step

## Deploying to hosted service
1. Authenticate with ` graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ <ACCESS_TOKEN>`
1. In another window and within `airswap-protocols`, run `yarn test`
1. From `airswap-protocols/tools/subgraph` run `yarn prepare:mainnet && yarn codegen && yarn remove-local; yarn create-local; yarn deploy:mainnet --access-token <access_token>`
