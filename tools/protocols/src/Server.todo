Implementation:
  ☐ Emit pricing on subscribe
  ☐ Use `senderServer` http endpoint for `consider` if it is set.
  ☐ Make sure all addresses get lowercased.
  ☐ Check that we properly handle malformed payloads from the maker servers.
  ☐ Potentially make `addTokenPairPriceUpdateListener` subscribe too
  ☐ Throw errors for malformed server responses
