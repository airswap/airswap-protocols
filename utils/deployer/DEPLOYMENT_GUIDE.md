# Deployment Guide

This guide walks through the process of deploying contracts to public Ethereum networks and verifying contracts on Etherscan. The process requires an Ethereum mnemonic phrase, Etherscan API key, and Infura API key.

1. Run `yarn install` from `airswap-protocols/` to ensure dependencies are installed

2. Change directories to `utils/deployer`

2. Create a `.env` file with:

```
MNEMONIC=""
INFURA_API_KEY=""
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""

DEVELOPMENT_WETH=""
DEVELOPMENT_STAKE=""

RINKEBY_WETH="0xc778417E063141139Fce010982780140Aa0cD5Ab"
RINKEBY_STAKE="0xCC1CBD4f67cCeb7c001bD4aDF98451237a193Ff8"

MAINNET_WETH="0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2"
MAINNET_STAKE="0x27054b13b1b798b345b591a4d22e6562d47ea75a"
```
- Fill in MNEMONIC, INFURA_API_KEY, and ETHERSCAN_API_KEY with your values.
- `<network>_STAKE` expects an ERC20 token.
- `<network>_WETH` expects a contract that can take in ETH and transform the value into an ERC20 token.
- Samples of both these contracts can be found within @airswap/tokens.
  
**Note, the `MAINNET_STAKE` and `RINKEBY_STAKE` are AST ERC20 Tokens on those networks*

**Note, the `MAINNET_WETH` and `RINKEBY_WETH` are WETH ERC20 Tokens on those networks*

3. Update `migrations/1_initial_migration.js` with correct deployment order

4. run `yarn clean` to remove any prior`./build` and `./flattened` folders

5. run `yarn migrate --network <desired_network>`

If looking to verify on a network besides `development`, one can append the verification commands for the contracts that wish to be verified
```
yarn migrate --network rinkeby && sleep 40 && yarn verify Types Wrapper DelegateFactory Indexer Swap flatten/Flattened.sol --network rinkeby
```
