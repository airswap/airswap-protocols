Swap [Source Code](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-protocols/tree/master/protocols/swap) and [README](../README.md)

## Introduction

The Swap Protocol is a peer-to-peer protocol for trading Ethereum tokens that allows two parties to exchange tokens in an atomic transaction. It is a non-custodial exchange settlement contract. The new additions to the contract allow for trading of ERC-721 tokens, delegation for token trades to pre-authorized parties, and optionally distributing affiliate fees in tokens to a party who facilitates peers meeting. In addition, previous behavior of the AirSwap protocol is maintained in terms of swapping ERC-20 tokens. One significant change related to security is that the Swap protocol now does not deal with ether at all. The contracts are compiled with v0.5.10.a6ea5b19 (0.5.10 stable release).

## Structure

The Swap contract is comprised a contract, an interface, and a library.

Note that state-modifying public signal points are minimized in this contract, reducing
the exploit surface to incorrect arguments to swap, authorize, cancel, invalidate, and revoke.

## Invariants

#### 1. No ether or tokens should be held by the contract address.

- Although `selfdestruct` can forcefully send money to any non-payable contract; this is out of scope of review, and because this.balance is not used in the code, cannot lead to security issues.
  No functions are payable and thus stuck ether due to improper function calls is not possible.
  By inspection, in all branches of this function, swap, and safeTransferAny/transferAny, either the trade succeeds or an exception is generated by a ‘require’. At no point can these functions return false or fail silently without throwing.
- All transfers in the execution function are between the maker and taker or a maker and affiliate; at no point is a token transfer performed using the Swap contract’s address. Tokens can however be sent to the contract by accident, and will remain stuck as there is no withdrawal mechanism for any of the supported token standards. Per V1 Exchange contract (0x8fd3121013a07c57f0d69646e86e7a4880b467b7), there is 0 ether and < \$.10 stored. While we recommend considering a withdrawal backdoor, it introduces complexity that may be undesirable from a business perspective.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 2. Affiliate trades supply appropriate fees

- safeTransferFrom is used for ERC-721 and transferFrom is called with affiliate.param as amount, transfer works by manual verification of transfer flow and testing; see also the original Swap audit report. A require is not required for safeTransferFrom as the contract signature guarantees there is no return parameter.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 3. All flows are identical (no calls to underlying token contract) until the internal transferToken call.

- In the ERC-20 case, reverts will occur on the underlying transferFrom implemented methods. Applications using this contract may want to do pre-checks on known tokens to do better user experience.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 4. Signatures cannot be forged or duplicated.

- In the swap flow, validation is required on all of the order parameters to the swap function. Every item in the order is included in a hash along with an identifier tag (nonce), uniquely identifying each Order object and preventing hash/signature reuse between different items. All items that are hashed are fixed size and stored in memory, making it impossible to exploit padding or offset vulnerabilities.
- In both cases, ecrecover is performed, and checked against the relevant maker (or signer, checked separately for authorization).
- The output of a correct ecrecover cannot be forged without knowledge of the signing private key.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 5. Trades performed cannot exceed authorized timestamp.

- Only two methods can be used to authorize delegated signing in the contract: authorize and revoke. No other methods modify the approval state.
- Both allow setting of an expiry parameter, and the authorization check used in Swap.sol checks that the block timestamp is less than this parameter or throws.
- Revoke deletes the mapping signal, which will default the value to 0 if queried.
- Block timestamp can technically be manipulated by miners, who may attempt to prolong authorizations that are about to expire. The gain, however, seems marginal, and the cost of this attack relative to Swap trading volume make it unlikely to be of concern.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 6. Orders can never move states once they are CANCELED or TAKEN.

- The first function check ensures an order is not already taken or cancelled or reverts, making further successful swaps impossible. Ensuring that an order status cannot move from CANCELED to something else.
- Cancels also can only be performed on OPEN order and checks are done to ensure the order was not TAKEN.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 7. Orders can only be successfully taken once.

- By (8), orders either revert or complete successfully. The TAKEN flag is set before any functions that have side effects or external calls are used, preventing its modification through e.g. re-entrancy, and it is not reset in the function, indicating the TAKEN flag will remain set unless a revert occurs.
- If a revert occurs, the trade is not taken, so this is correct. If no revert occurs, the trade was (and will stay) taken, so this is correct.
- The first function check ensures an order is not already taken or cancelled or reverts, making further successful swaps impossible.
- Orders could potentially be replayed on a different Swap contract, if e.g. old au- throizations exist on another contract. The legacy signature is modified to require an additional "0" byte to prevent such replay attacks; all future Swap contracts should increment this bid to maintain replay protection against old authorizations.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

#### 10. Swap function either successfully execute swap or revert

- By manual inspection of all branches of swap and transferFrom, no functions can fail silently without causing a REVERT. In the case no REVERT branch is hit, both sides of the swap must have been successfully executed. Note that require is used in the ERC-20 case to handle tokens where a bad transfer may fail silently without reversions. This is the only external call other than safeTransferFrom, which has no return value and therefore cannot fail silently.
- **This invariant currently holds as-is.**

## Analysis

#### Slither (static analyzer)

- No medium or severe issues were found.
- Choosing Solidity compiler 0.5.10 over the recommended 0.5.3 because of issues fixed in ABIEncoderV2.
- Timestamps were used for comparisons though an attack seems unlikely to be of concern.
- Different Solidity versions are used not with AirSwap specific code, only with Migrations (used from Truffle boilerplate) and Open-Zeppelin library.
- Cases of \_name notation versus mixedCase were ignored.

#### Regression Tests

End-to-end tests for the ERC-20 flow were performed on Rinkeby prior to deploy on Mainnet to confirm behavior was consistent with prior Swap contract.

## Notes

- Because of two issues found with ABIEncoderV2, we ensured that the newest version of the Solidity compiler was used where those issues were resolved. More information can be found at the [Ethereum Foundation blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).
- There may be issues where if someone tries to use the cancel function and submit a large array of order nonces, out of gas issues.
- We note a potential loss vector for Swap contract users; the affiliate fee could exceed the token fee. If the user-facing libraries or interfaces are not appropriately checking affiliate fee size, this could lead to makers being tricked into spending all or most of their money as an affiliate fee. We recommend clearly communicating this to users and including a check in any high-level code released for distribution. Another mitigation is to switch to limited, amount-based approvals (as in ERC-20), or to require that the affiliate fee cannot exceed the trade size.
- We assume the ERC-20 super-contract is good; recommend noting its audit trail / history as well as the audit trail / history for the version of Zeppelin being used. Recommend fixing this dependency version formally. This is done, and a version of Zeppelin audited by "Level K" is used; we recommend carefully considering the scope/impact of their audit. (noted above by AirSwap)
- Constants are ABI decoded at deployment time rather than hardcoded; this is fine assuming the ABI encoder works (which is required to decode orders from memory regardless).
- Smart contracts are a nascent space, and no perfect security audit procedure has thus far been perfected for their deployment. We welcome any suggestions or comments on this report, its contents, our methodology, or potential gaps in coverage.
